					<p class="gucci">So, this is my <b>first</b> post. Or my first anything. This is only going to <b>expand</b> and I'm very excited. I'll be <i>learning</i> how to maintain this bad boy.
					What's <i>next</i>? I'll tell you. I will now learn how to make posts separately, as if this is a legit blog. Wouldn't know how to start, but I'm excited to <b>find</b> out. And holy fuck
					I'm growing. But wait, there's more to this rant. I want to thank one special person, someone who I hold dear. He's my <b>mentor</b>, my <b>hero</b>, but more than that, a very good <b>friend</b>.
					Trust me when I say this, there will be a page dedicated to him. I promise. Here, enjoy this <a href"https://github.com/ayojackay">awesome</a> site. Stay tuned. Oh, and this is 
				 (<b>beware, he's really sexy. like mouth watering, mkay</b>) <a href="https://github.com/v6">his</a>.
